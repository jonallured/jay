This project is a collection of commands that I find helpful. It's built using [thor][].

[thor]: https://github.com/rails/thor

## Installation

For now I'm just installing it locally. To do that first clone the repo and then have rake install it:

```bash
rake install
```

And that's it! Upgrading is the same.

> [!NOTE]
> This will install to the current Ruby so keep in mind that other Rubies could have an older version or no version at all.
